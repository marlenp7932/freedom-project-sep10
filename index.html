            <h2> How is CS Used in Biology </h2>
            <h5>What is their connection</h5>
            <p>CS in the topic of Biology is used tools and methods usually for CS, and to comprehend and read data for biology. The middle ground being called Bioinformatics.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
         <p>A lot of computer science is used to solve problems by reading ideas and research that would usually take an extreme amount of time to be able to analyze. There are in general a lot of benefits to having CS inventions and innovative ideas, including</p>
             <ul class="list-group">
              <li class="list-group-item">More efficient for scientists to be able to create solutions</li>
              <li class="list-group-item">Better to understand analyzed data</li>
              <li class="list-group-item">Easier to read said data (to add on above ^)</li>
                </ul>
            <p>This innovation subject overall can be extremely useful, especially since its a bit newer, and can be extremely useful in the future. </p>

            <h2> Some Examples </h2>
            <p>For the current issues in this field, there have been a few ideas made on how to minimize the issues and be able to create an efficient solution. The following included are some innovations that have specific problems that </p>
            <h6>Berkeley Lights Lightning Optofluidic Platform</h6>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
         <p>Is used in developing T-cell therapies which is usually very complicated because [from articles states below] “T cell-mediated tumor death relies on complicated cell-cell interactions and several complex mechanisms.”</p>
         <p>What does this mean? Basically that said T-cell analyzed evidence takes a lot to understand and research, so using said invention can make it much quicker to understand these complicated mechanisms usually done to get and utilize the research.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="container">
         <p>This technology is very helpful when needing to quicken up any screenings necessary </p>
         <p> Basically means it's extremely helpful in sequencing genomes, and a plus is its much more cost effective and is much quicker than other similar machines out there</p>
                </div>
            <div class="container-fluid3">
                <h6>Finalized Thoughts</h6>
                <p>A lot of the time researching the above also gave the ideas of how there are many details that can be improved. The current tech, while it does work well for their respective problems, the field is constantly evolving, and CS tech is constantly getting much more and more improved. With that thought in mind, there are definitely different ways that CS will eventually be used in the future.</p>
